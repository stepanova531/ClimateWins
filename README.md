# ClimateWins-Unsupervised-ML
Machine Learning with Python
# Objective
Use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change.
- Finding new patterns in weather changes;
- Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm;
- Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing;
- Forecasting future weather conditions and Determining the safest places for people to live.
# Scenario
ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in thepast 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.
# Data
Open source data collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set project](https://www.ecad.eu/).

1- Data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from 1960 to 2022. Data is available [here](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A2/DATASET%20weather_prediction_dataset_processed.csv)

2- Batch of four different weather conditions (cloudy, rainy, sunny, and sunrise) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset)
# Tools
